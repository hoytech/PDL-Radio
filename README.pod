=head1 NAME

PDL::Sound - Sound interface for PDL::Sound

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ## Play 1000 Hz sine wave for 5 seconds:
    PDL::Sound->new->play("sine", 5, 1000);

    ## Play .5 seconds of a sine wave, phase shift 180 degrees, play another .5:
    PDL::Sound->new->play("sine", .5, 1000)
                   ->play("sine", .5, 1000, PI);

    ## Plot 5 periods of a sawtooth wave:
    PDL::Sound->new->plot("sawtooth", 5, 1);

    ## Play PSK-31 encoded message
    PDL::Sound->new->play("psk", 1000, "hello world!");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a work-in-progress library for generating sound data and playing it through L<Pulse Audio|http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/>. Pulse Audio makes redirecting the audio output to programs like L<fldigi|http://www.w1hkj.com/Fldigi.html> really easy.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<The PDL::Sound github repo|https://github.com/hoytech/PDL-Sound>

L<PDL::Audio> is very similar to this module except that it interfaces to sndlib where this module interfaces to pulseaudio. L<PDL::Audio> is a pain to setup and I couldn't figure out how to send data to fldigi. Also, L<Pulse::Audio> doesn't seem to be on CPAN anymore?
